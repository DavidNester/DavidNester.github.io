	<p>We are three 2018 graduates of Eastern Mennonite University in Harrisonburg, VA.
	We will be starting our trip on May 9th by flying from Washington DC to San Jose, CA.
	We will end approximately 2 months later in Delaware passing through 
	Sacramento, Carson City, Denver, Omaha, Madison, Chicago, Goshen, Bluffton, Pittsburgh,
	 and Washington DC (and many more in between). If you would like to host us or give us
	 a meal along the way, it would be greatly appreciated! Send us an <a href="mailto:14nesterd@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>
