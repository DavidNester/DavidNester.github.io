title: Buy Us A Meal
---
<center>
<h1>Want to buy us a meal?</h1>
<p>We are not at risk of starvation but require thousands of calories each day and certainly like to live on the cheap in ways that 
some would consider inhumane (voluntarily). If you would like to stop this, send
us a few dollars (or a lot of them) with one of the following options and we will send you a picture of us
eating your meal along with a note of gratitude! You can send instructions with your money
if you want us to send a funny picture, use it for something specific, or have any other creative
ideas to go with it! Please include a phone number or an email if you don't think we have one for you already.</p>

<p>If you are somewhere on the route (see home page) and would like to host us for a night
send us an email (see bottom of page).</p>
