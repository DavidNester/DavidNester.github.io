	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<img src="/res/personal/bikepic.jpg" alt="Bike Picture" width="378" height="504" float="middle">
	<p>My name is David Nester. I grew up in Bluffton, Ohio and went to college at Eastern Mennonite University
	in Harrisonburg, Virginia. I majored in Computer Science and Mathematics. In August 2018, I will start working
	as a software developer at Epic Systems in Verona, WI.</p>
	<p>I have played soccer ever since I have attended school. I am an avid sports fan and watch 
	all the time (this led to my site <a href="https://davidnester.github.io/sportstreamer">SportStreamer</a>).
	My teams are Arsenal FC and Real Madrid FC. Outside of soccer, I am a major fan of the Ohio State Buckeyes (CFB and BB), Cleveland Browns, and Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>
	<p>I also enjoy a lot of tv shows, specifically comedies. My favorites (in a close but not exact order) are Community, Arrested Development,
	30 Rock, The Office, Rick and Morty, Parks and Recreation, and Futurama. I have many more that I like but didn't quite make the list.</p>
	<p>When I am not watching something, I enjoy being outdoors a lot. I love anything with pedals (uni, bi, tri).
	I try to use bicycle as my main form of transportation. You can check out my cross country ride <a href="https://davidnester.github.io/biketrip">here</a>.
	I also enjoy Ultimate Frisbee, running, and hiking.</p>
