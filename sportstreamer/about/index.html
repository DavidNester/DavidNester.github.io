<h1>About</h1>
<p>I love watching sports! Without cable, I generally have to find ways to stream them online.
The best way I have found to do this has been through the various forums on reddit. I have
gotten tired of sorting through all of the comments and navigating between the bookmarked 
forums so I decided to make this website. With one bookmark, you can easily switch between sports
and get all of the links without sorting through any of the obnoxious comments. I do not host
any steams. I just compile them in one place without clutter or ads.</p>

<p>I made this site as a learning experience and also because I felt it had value to me. I have 
lots of improvements in mind and they will come as I have time to add them. Check out
the <a href="https://davidnester.github.io/sportstreamer/donate">donate page</a> for a
list of updates! My goal now is to spread this to as many people as possible!</p>

<p><b>Happy streaming!</b></p>
