<h1>About</h1>
<p>I love watching sports! Without cable, I generally have to find ways to stream them online.
The best way I have found to do this has been through the various forums on reddit. I have
gotten tired of sorting through all of the comments and navigating between the bookmarked 
forums so I decided to make this website. With one bookmark, you can easily switch between sports
and get all of the links without sorting through any of the obnoxious comments.</p>

<p>This website gets all of the information from reddit but needs the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi/related?hl=en-US">extension</a>
 to do it. I did not make the extension but am happy with it for the time being. It has
some issues which I will try to fix when I get the chance.</p>
 
<p>I made this site as a learning experience and also because I felt it had value to me. I
have no intention of including ads though I may consider banner ads (not pop ups). I have 
lots of improvements in mind and they will come as I have time to add them. Check out
the <a href="https://davidnester.github.io/sportstreamer/donate">donate page</a> for a
list of updates!</p>

<p><b>Happy streaming!</b></p>
